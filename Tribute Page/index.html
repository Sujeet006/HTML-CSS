            After the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance
            (NDA) won a landslide in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Modi was sworn
            in as Prime Minister (PM) of India on 26 May 2014, becoming the
            first Indian PM to be born after the country's independence from the
            British Empire in 1947.[235] Modi's second term as PM began in 2019
            following the NDA's 2019 Lok Sabha election win. On 6 December 2020,
            he became the fourth-longest-serving Prime Minister of India and the
            longest-serving non-Congress prime minister.

            The activities of a number of Hindu nationalist organisations
            increased in scope after Modi's appointment as prime minister,
            sometimes with the government's support.[256][257] These activities
            included a Hindu religious conversion programme, a campaign against
            the supposed Islamic practice of "Love Jihad" and attempts to
            celebrate Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, by members
            of the right-wing organisation Hindu Mahasabha.[258][259] Government
            officials, including the Home Minister, defended the conversion
            programmes.p>
